# Social-distance-monitoring
### Covid19 pandemic has made it important to maintain 6ft distance for safety and prevent the covid from spreading. This project aims to automate Social distace monitoring.
### I use a pretrained object detection model to detect person and using OpenCV analyse the distance between the detect persorn. This is phase 1 of project. In phase 2 camera caliberation will be added to improve the performance 
###  Tools: OpenCV, Darknet, YOLOv4
